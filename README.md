Tests were made from one PC with initialized 2 daemons on localhost, so there wasn't made any premines and there is not performed any ScaryCoin mining in real life.
I have launched this project at the beginning just for understanding better how forking works, but as I have invested a lot of time in this project, I have decided to give a chance for ScaryCoin to live.
So in future, I will look for any updates and I am also looking for partners - developers.
